# About me

I am Nazneen and I am a security consultant at Thoughtworks living in Pune, India. \
I am also an Android App Development Enthusiast, Privacy Conscious and Security Enthusiast.

I am a  lifelong learner who thrives on writing to think critically and enhance my understanding. Sharing my insights strengthens my grasp on concepts.

Fascinated by learning & development space and change management, I adore mysteries and perpetually seek new knowledge. Swimming, dancing, and traveling are my joys, and I have started blogging about my travels [here](https://myquestaroundtheworld.travel.blog/). Exploring diverse cuisines and indulging in numismatics interest me.

Connect with me on  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nzneen) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nazneen-rupawalla-4b8a8a3b) to exchange ideas, offer suggestions on my notes and blogs. You are also welcome to share your input via pull requests on the repository.
