# About me

My name is Nazneen Rupawalla and I am a Security Consultant at ThoughtWorks living in Pune, India.   
I am also an Android App Development Enthusiast, Privacy Conscious and Security Enthusiast.

I believe in being a life long learner and learn best when I write it down as it helps with thinking critically and questions my understanding. Sharing it with others strengthens my understanding. I will use this space to share my lessons while I solve the requirements at hand as part of my role. I have blogged about writing secure Android apps and a couple of technical tips that may be handy.  
  
I am in love with the L&D space, interested in change management, love mysteries and a lifelong learner. I enjoy swimming, dancing and traveling. I have recently started blogging about my travel which can be read [here](https://myquestaroundtheworld.travel.blog/). I love trying out different cuisines and have interest in numismatics.

I can be reached at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nzneen) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nazneen-rupawalla-4b8a8a3b) if you want to share more ideas, have suggestions around my notes and blogs.
