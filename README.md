# About me

I am Nazneen and I am a Cyber Security Engineer at Thoughtworks, where I leverage my expertise advocating for privacy and security.

As an international speaker, I share insights on these topics at various platforms. You can find my published articles on [Thoughtworks Insights](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/security/security-consulting-part-two), and watch [recordings of my talks on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7EHLA9HNnsMUNvRuxzRN8nf79g36X8Hv).

Beyond my professional interests, I am deeply passionate about the learning and development space, love mysteries, and enjoy engaging in growth-related conversations.

In my leisure time, I indulge in swimming, dancing, and traveling, while also exploring different cuisines and pursuing my interest in numismatics.

I chronicle my travel adventures on my travel blog: [Quests With Nazneen](https://questswithnazneen.travel.blog/)
